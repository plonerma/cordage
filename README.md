Parameterize experiments using dataclasses and use cordage to easily parse configuration files and command line
options.

> [!IMPORTANT]

## Motivation

In many cases, we want to execute and parameterize a main function.
Since experiments can quickly become more complex and may use an increasing number of parameters,
it often makes sense to store these parameters in a `dataclass`.

Cordage makes it easy to load configuration files or configure the experiment via the commandline.


## Quick Start
### Installation

In an environment of your choice (python>=3.8), run:

```bash
pip install cordage
```

#### Example

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
import cordage


@dataclass
class Config:
    lr: float = 5e-5
    name: str = "MNIST"


def train(config: Config):
    """Help text which will be shown."""
    print(config)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    cordage.run(train)
```


To use cordage, you need a main function (e.g. `func`) which takes a dataclass configuration object as an argument.
Use `cordage.run(func)` to execute this function with arguments passed via the command line. Cordage parses the
configuration and creates an output directory (if the function accepts `output_dir`, it will be passed as such).

See the examples in the examples directory for more details.
